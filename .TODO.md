This is a fresh new JS library. It should be a vanilla regular contemporary JavaScript without compilation or something. I should be able to drop a script link to this script at GitHub, at any website, and it should work.

The purpose of the library is to inspect elements on any HTML page, capture this element by clicking on it, and explain what this element means in the context of the current web page and the current application.

First, you should create all any files you need, especially JavaScript main file.

Then the first step we will implement is following. We need an ability to run this library by calling it explicitly. For example, we will create a listener on some button on a web page that will run the library. When the library started, it switches to so-called capture mode.In this mode we should be able to inspect current web page elements and capture the element which is clicked. We should suppress the default behavior of this element because it could be either a button or something even more important. No need to highlight elements during inspection, either highlight the selected element. Just capture it programmatically for the further actions. For debugging purposes, it is possible to output this element to console.
